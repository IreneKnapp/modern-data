It sure would be nice if finalizing nodes were a method of the node
representation!

The important parts of computing the value type of a node need to be in the
library always, even with a user-provided node representation.

Several nodes and stream events, for no good reason, express their children
as hashes instead of arbitrary nodes.  Using arbitrary nodes leaves this
choice up to the client programmer, since one can always use a
value_from_context if one prefers the compactness of the hash.  In particular,
forcing this the way it is presently might cause trouble for Teaquel down the
line...

We should allow for context representations the same way that we allow for
node representations.
