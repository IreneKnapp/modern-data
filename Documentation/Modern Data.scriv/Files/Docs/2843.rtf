\f0\fs28 \cf0 A 
\f1 modern_builtin_identifier
\f0  is an enumerated value, one of a sparsely-allocated set which fits in a sixteen-bit range.  They are used with nodes of 
\f1 modern_node_type_builtin
\f0  to represent certain functions and values which are, as the reader might already be imagining, built-in to the system because they are required for its normal usage.  The represented values are comprised of flow-control primitives, logical combinators, comparators, and operations on primitive values and types, both atomic and aggregate.  The actual names and numbers of each are, for brevity, given alongside their types and semantics in the section Builtin identifiers.}
