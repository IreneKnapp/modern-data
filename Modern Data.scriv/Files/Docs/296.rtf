\f0\fs24 \cf0 It is worth noting that, while many platforms support 128-bit float values, many others do not.  Even when the compiler does, often the system library does not; not least because there are no standardized names for the functions (though GNU libquadmath uses the \'93q\'94 suffix on the ISO C99 base names).  Modern Data is of course primarily an interchange format, and only secondarily a set of libraries; therefore, it does not try to resolve this difficulty!  Instead of addressing the problem, the libraries simply use the platform\'92s largest available floating-point type, which is usually 80 bits, for all function parameters and return values, while converting these to and from 128-bit representations for interchange.\
\
Should 128-bit floats become practical on the key platforms where Modern Data is supported, it is expected that the API will be changed to use these types, breaking linking compatibility but retaining source and over-the-wire compatibility.  Hence, code linked against present versions of the library will interoperate with future systems which use 128-bit floats natively, but will never be able to directly use more precision than the system has available.}
