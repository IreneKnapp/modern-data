Experimental Code
=================

This source-code repository is published here in the hope that it will be
useful or at least interesting, but is very likely to be in an unfinished
state, and not necessarily a consistent one, either.

The sole representation is that (except for the parts that aren't), this
code is authored by me - Irene Knapp.

If the repository contains information about its own licensing, that
information is normative; otherwise, all rights are reserved and it is
provided for information only.

If you do something that requires me to write a better disclaimer, I will be
very irate.
